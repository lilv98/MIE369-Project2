Java package for propositional and first-order logic

o To clean all .class files, backups, and documentation, 
  type 'make clean' from this directory (i.e. the one
  with this README file).

o To build all of the files, type 'make all' from this
  directory.

o To generate documentation, type 'make docs' from this
  directory.  All docs will go in the 'docs' subdirectory.

o To run the text interface to the system, type
  'run logic.LShell'.  This should invoke the proper
   script for your system (UNIX or Windows).
  'test.lsh' contains a sample script that you can
  run from within this shell by typing 'exec test.lsh'.
  Type 'help' from the shell for more information.

o To run some of the test files, use run, e.g.:
  'run logic.LShell'
  'run logic.add.TestADD'
  'run logic.add.fo.FOADD'
  'run logic.kb.prop.PropKb'
  'run logic.kb.fol.FOLKb'
